DESCRIPTION:

What are sets and how to use them What are the most common methods of set and how to use them When to use sets versus lists How to iterate into a set What are dictionaries and how to use them When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets What is a key in a dictionary How to iterate over a dictionary What is a lambda function What are the map, reduce and filter functions

    Squared simple - Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix. - 0-square_matrix_simple.py.
    Search and replace - Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list. - 1-search_replace.py.
    Unique addition - Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer). - 2-uniq_add.py.
    Present in both - Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets. - 3-common_elements.py.
    Only differents - Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set. - 4-only_diff_elements.py.
    Number of keys - Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary. - 5-number_keys.py.
    Print sorted dictionary - Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys. - 6-print_sorted_dictionary.py.
